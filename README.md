# Slither
A popular and an interesting snake game.It would definately take you to flashback of childhood memories where we all used to play this game very fondly.
Let's refresh those memories and play that game again.
Game rules:-
1. You can only use:-
1. Up arrow key to move up
2. Down arrow key to move down.
3. Right arrow key to move right.
4. Left arrow key to move left.
Your primary aim is to maximise your number of points by eating apples(virtually :D)
But there is a twist in the game.
If the snake's head collides with snake's body then the game is over.
If you strike or make any contact with the wall then the game would stop then and there displaying your final points.
So what are you waiting for take this challenge with you and gain maximum points.
Alriight then see you in the arena...!!!
ALL THE BEST!!!
